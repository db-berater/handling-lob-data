# Session - How to handle LOB Data in Microsoft SQL Server
This repository contains all code examples and the presentation for my session "How to handle LOB Data in Microsoft SQL Server".
All scripts are created for the use of Microsoft SQL Server (Version 2016 or higher)!
To work with the scripts it is required to have the workshop database [ERP_Demo](https://www.db-berater.de/downloads/ERP_DEMO_2012.BAK) installed on your SQL Server Instance.
The last version of the demo database can be downloaded here:
